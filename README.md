# PCA-and-feature-selection_sklearn
### Principal component analysis and feature selection using Python 

Using the bankruptcy data ('data.csv') available at https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction, create two Random Forest classification models - one using all the features and  the other using the components from the primary component analysis. Target data is in the first column ('Bankrupt?') and the rest of the columns contain the feature data.
